# Build-Grad-Portfolio

A simple BASH script that creates a set of folders that correspond to the GWD Comprehensive Assessment's requirements. John Abbott College GWD students can use these folders to organize their backups. It is highly recommended that this set of folders be saved on OneDrive.

## How to Use
- Download the shell script to your desktop.
- Open the macOS Terminal (search for it in Spotlight; or go to /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app).
- Drag this file into the Terminal window (you will see the path to the file be written out. Such as "/Users/billypoppins/Desktop/build-grad-portfolio.sh"). 
- Hit Return to execute the script.
- A new "_Comprehensive Assessment" folder will appear on your Desktop.
- Move this folder to your OneDrive folder.

## Note
Avoid adding very large files to your OneDrive folder near the end of a class period. You want to give OneDrive the opportunity to completely upload your files before the end of class.
