# Build-Grad-Portfolio

A simple BASH script that:

- Turns macOS invisible files visible system-wide.
- Creates a set of files and folders that correspond to the GWD Web App defaults.

## How to Use
- Download the shell script to your desktop.
- Open the macOS Terminal (search for it in Spotlight).
- Create a folder on your desktop called "CA".
- In the Terminal window type "cd " (cd followed by a space) then drag the CA folder into the Terminal window (this adds the path). Hit Return.
- Then type "sh " (sh followed by a space)  and drag the downloaded script file into the window. Hit Return.
- Follow the on-screen instructions.

## Note
Most files created by this script are empty. You will have to add the HTML or PHP code yourself during Web V (fall semester) and Portfolio (final semester).
